# Hi there, I'm Nirbhai - Tech Lead / Data Scientist / Machine Learning Engineer! 👨🏻‍💻
> _"No one in this world is smart enough to be hundred percent wrong" - unknown_

<br />

🤸‍♂️ I’m currently on a sabatical and having fun doing things that I haven't found an employer to pay me to do yet

<br />

### 🔭 I’m currently working on ☝🏻 
  * building some of the most widely used Machine Learning/ Data Science methods from scratch. In order to gain a deeper understanding of the underlying algorithms and tradeoffs. (such as pandas like data wrangling structures and methods, numpy like data types, scikit like regression methods, decision trees & forests, neural nets, etc)
  * Analysing covid numbers for 🇮🇳 - based on a similar study done by Sir David Spiegelhalter for 🇬🇧
  * Project Euler - https://projecteuler.net/about

<br />

### 🌱 In my free time I love ✨
  * going for long walks in Dhauladhars of lower Himalayas 🚶  
  * reading and all things literature 📚
  * looking at trees outside my window 🌲
  * driving 🚘, doing breathwork 😮‍💨 and yoga 🧘‍♂️

<br />

### 🤔 I'm currently thinking about 💡
  * Howcome classical statistical models were ok with less data but new machine learning models based on same are not
  * Why is Bayesian way of inferencing probabilities so unintuitive
  * What is a good way to do MLOps

<br />

### 👓🤓 I'm currently reading 📖
  * Data Science from Scratch - Joel Grus
  * Practical Statistics for Data Scientists - Peter Gedeck, Andrew Bruce, Peter C. Bruce
  * The Art of Statistics: Learning from Data - David Spiegelhalter
